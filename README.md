# Book-Management-System
The Book Management System project in C focuses on creating a database structure to store book details and implementing functionalities like adding, updating, searching, and deleting books. The program should enable users to interact via a command-line interface, allowing them to perform CRUD operations efficiently. Additionally, sorting and filtering functions based on price and rating, as well as identifying top-ranking books, should be implemented. Thorough testing and documentation are essential for ensuring system functionality and usability. Ongoing optimization efforts can enhance the program's performance and scalability.
